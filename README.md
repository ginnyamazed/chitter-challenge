## Introduction

Chitter-Challenge is typically a team project during the Makers Academy Coding Bootcamp.  It 
is created using Ruby, Cabybara and Sinatra.  It is a Twitter copy-cat where users can create an account, create, and 
read 'Peeps'.

I have chosen to redo this task, AKA Ginny's Quacker, this time around using [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) and 
deploying it to Heroku.  

## Access

Quacker is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and can be accessed [here](https://ginnysquacker.herokuapp.com)

## Technologies

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/about)
- [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org), 7.0.1
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- styling was done with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) through [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)

Testing was attempted with the [Rails testing framework](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html) and 
[RSpec](https://rspec.info/), however, both methods proved unproductive.  This would be an area I would attempt to 
improve if I were to continue working on this project.  The errors were due to my unfamiliarity with Rails and how to 
manipulate how it attempts to test through the MVC configurations.
